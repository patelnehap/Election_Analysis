# Election_Analysis
## Overview of Election Audit :

Board of Colorado Election analysis employee Tom and Seth have to present the election audit results to the election commission. 
They are tasked to present the total number of votes cast, the total broken down for each candidate and the percentage of vote for each candidate by county. Also the commission board wants an analysis of votes by each county and also the county that cast the highest number of votes.

## Election-Audit Results:

Tom and Seth were given the election result data in csv format to analyse and present their findings. 
The analysis could be done manually using various office tools but the board wanted to automate the process, so it could be run for other counties too. So Tom and Seth decided to use the powerful automation scripting tool Python to present the election audit results.
They were able to get the following results :

Total number of Votes cast : 369,711

Votes (# and %) cast by county:
Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
-------------------------
Largest County Turnover: Denver

Votes(# and %) by Candidate:
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

The candidate that won by highest # of votes is Diana DeGette.

Winner Candidate Data:

Winner: Diana DeGette
Winning Vote Count: 272,892
Winning Percentage: 73.8%

## Election-Audit Summary:

Tom and Seth were delighted to present their analysis to the election commission board. 
They also let the board know that they can use the same script to run the analysis for different counties. They gave the board two options to modify the script:
### read a different csv file and it will present the data for the counties listed in the csv(assumption the column headers are the same order as the current one)
### Replace the data in the current csv with election data from other regions and it will display the data accordingly.
The board was impressed at how easy it was to run the script to get the analysis written to a text file.
so now that the process is automated, the board admin member can run the script for any election and get the analysis in few secs.
